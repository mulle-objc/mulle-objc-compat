This library maps
[Apple runtime](//developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective_c_runtime?language=objc)
functions to their [mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io) counterparts.
This makes porting of existing programs that use Apple runtime functions easier.
If you can get by with the limited set of functions, these functions are
preferable to use over their mulle-objc counterparts for the sake of portability
and familiarity.
